<h1> Octane </h1>

<b>High-Speed Daredevil<br>
<br>
One day, Octavio Silva was bored. In fact, he was bored most days. Son of the preoccupied CEO of Silva<br>
Pharmaceuticals and wanting for nothing in life, he entertained himself by performing death-defying<br>
stunts and posting holovids of them for his fans to gawk over. So, this day, he decided to set the course<br>
record for a nearby Gauntlet by launching himself across the finish line – using a grenade.<br>
<br>
As he lay in triage hours later, the doctors informed him that the damage done to his legs meant his daredevil<br>
days were over. That didn’t sit well with Octavio, who turned to an old friend for help: Ajay Che, who he<br>
guilted into forging an order to replace his legs with bionic ones. Suddenly able to repair his limbs at a moment’s<br>
notice, Octavio decided petty online stunts weren’t enough: the ultimate adrenaline rush, the Apex Games,<br>
was calling. Now, he’s going to become an Apex Champion doing the most incredible, death-defying moves anyone’s ever<br>
seen. Maybe in the arena, he won’t be so bored.<br>
