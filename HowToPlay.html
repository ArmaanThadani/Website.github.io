<!--******************************Explaination on Legends****************************************-->
<br>
<center><h1><u><b>What are Legends</b></u></h1></center>
<p>
<center><b>First things first: Apex Legends is free to download, there are a ton of things you can buy via "microtransactions,"<br>
 but you aren't missing out on anything important if you choose to not spend a dime. There are a few characters you could unlock<br>
 right away by spending money, but you can eventually unlock them for free just by playing and accruing "Legend Tokens."<br>
Speaking of Legends, that's one of the biggest draws to this game. Each Legend has three unique abilities: a passive, a tactical and an ultimate.<br>
 For example, Pathfinder's passive ability is scanning beacons, his tactical ability is a grappling hook and his ultimate ability is a zip line.<br>
 Those words might not mean much of anything to you right now, but he's the only character who can do those three things<br>.More on the Legends on the next page

<!--******************************How to Land****************************************-->
<center><h1><u><b>How To Land On the Island</b></u></h1></center>
<p>
<center><b>When the game first begins, getting to the ground as quickly as possible can be the difference between life and death.<br>
 Even if you're just a split-second behind an enemy, that's a weapon someone is finding before you.<br>
 Each squad is designated one "Jumpmaster" (typically the third player to select their character) who controls the team's initial descent.<br>
 Fortunately, you can relinquish the role if you think a teammate might be more familiar with the map and more comfortable<br>
 with free-falling to the ground. That's why we're making this the bonus 11th tip, since it's not something <br>
 you need to know in order to succeed at the game.

<!--**************************What Should You Do In the Early Stages****************-->
<center><h1><u><b>What Should You Do In the Early Stages</b></u></h1></center>
<p>
<center><b>You drop in with no weapons, no ammo, no health kits, no shield, no nothing except your fists. And considering each<br>
 punch or kick only does 30 damage (you start with 100 health), you would need to land four melee attacks to knock down an opponent.<br>
 Good luck trying to accomplish that before an entire squad shoots you in the face. Thus, for the first minute or so of each game, beggars can't be choosers.<br>
Even if the first gun you encounter is one of the worst in the gameâ€”Mozambique here!<br>
it's much better to have a bad weapon than no weapon. (This is also why it's crucial to have toyed around with each gun in training.)<br>
 You'll also want to grab whatever ammo you stumble upon in case you decide to swap guns at some point.<br>
 Guns, and the projectiles to shoot from them, are just the tip of the iceberg, though. You also want to grab a helmet and a body shield for extra protection,<br>
 shield cells and batteries to recharge your shield as needed, syringes and med kits to nurse your wounds,<br>
 a backpack (to increase your inventory space), grenades (whether they be arc stars or frag and even thermite grenades), <br>
 knock-down shields, ultimate accelerants <br>
 and the all-important weapon attachments. (More on those shortly.)
