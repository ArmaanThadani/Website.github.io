<h1> Loba </h1>

<b>High Society Thief<br>
<br>
When Loba was nine, she looked on as simulacrum hitman Revenant killed her family. Left with nothing,<br>
Loba survived by picking pockets. As her skills improved, Loba used every tool at her disposal<br>
to lift herself from the gutter. Everything changed when she broke into a supposedly impenetrable facility<br>
and got her hands on the Jump Drive tech stored inside. With her new teleportation bracelet,<br>
the most secure and unattainable items were within her reach. So was her dream of living<br>
the high life.
<br>
Rumors spread across the Outlands: if you wanted something valuable and well guarded Loba’s<br>
who you go to. She was almost able to put her past behind her. But when Revenant joined the<br>
Games, her past catapulted into her future. Desperate to find a way to kill him, she sabotaged a facility<br>
full of Revenant bodies, bringing Skull Town and Thunderdome crashing down in the process.<br>
However, she learned it was just one of many such factories hidden across the Frontier. Now, she’s<br>
joined the Games to find a way to end him for good. It doesn’t hurt that the Arenas are brimming with treasures<br>
just waiting to be plucked. Revenge will come, if fortune favors her. In the meantime, some shiny things have<br>
caught her eye.<br>
