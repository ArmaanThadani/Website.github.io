<h1> Gibraltar </h1>

<b>Shielded Fortress<br>
<br>
Gibraltar is a gentle giant with a wild side. The son of two SARAS (Search and Rescue Association of Solace)<br>
volunteers, he has always been skilled at getting others out of dangerous situations that are common in<br>
the Outlands. However, he only began to understand the value of protecting others when he and his boyfriend<br>
stole his father’s motorcycle, took it on a joyride, and got trapped by a deadly mudslide. His parents<br>
saved them, and his father lost an arm in the process. Gibraltar has never forgotten that sacrifice and has<br>
devoted his life to helping those in need.
<br>
The Apex Games didn’t change that, but they changed what it meant. Many of Gibraltar’s friends and colleagues have<br>
competed in the Games for extra money, fame, and glory over the years, and some never came home. Gibraltar<br>
joined to keep them safe and, for the first time, his skills as a rescuer and his rebellious nature worked together.<br>
He’s now become an icon in the Apex Games, putting himself in the line of fire to protect his squad and send his<br>
opponents running for cover.<br>
