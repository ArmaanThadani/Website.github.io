<h1> Mirage </h1>

<b>Holographic Trickster<br>
<br>
Mirage is the kind of guy who likes to stand out. The youngest of four brothers, he perfected<br>
the art of fooling around to get attention. The one thing he took seriously was Holo-Pilot technology:<br>
introduced to the illusion-creating tech by his engineer mother, he poured over the mechanisms and<br>
learned all he could about them. Even when his brothers went MIA during the Frontier War, Mirage and his<br>
mother continued to develop holo devices, and the work brought them closer.<br>
<br>
While working as a bartender to make ends meet, Mirage heard amazing stories from his patrons about<br>
the Apex Games and the wealth and glory that came with victory. As good as both of those sounded, he knew<br>
he couldn’t risk leaving his mother childless – until she gave him a set of customized holo devices <br>
and told him to follow his dream. Mirage is now the life of the Apex Games, outwitting opponents and charming<br>
audiences across the Outlands.<br>
